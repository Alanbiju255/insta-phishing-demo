# Phishing Site Educational Demonstration

## Overview

This repository contains an educational demonstration of how a phishing site might work. The purpose of this project is **not** to create harmful or malicious content, but to help users and developers understand the tactics used by attackers. This demonstration mimics a phishing site designed to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and emails. By understanding how phishing sites operate, users can become more vigilant and protect themselves from real-world phishing attacks.

**Warning:** This repository contains code that simulates a phishing website. Do not use this code for malicious purposes. This code should only be used for educational purposes to help people understand the risks of phishing attacks.

## Key Features

- **User Interface (UI):** The site mimics an Instagram security check page to gather sensitive user information.
- **Phishing Simulation:** The form collects username, password, and email details and sends them to an email address (`sboy40225@gmail.com`) using FormSubmit (a form submission service).
- **Testimonials:** Fake testimonials to enhance the illusion of trustworthiness.
- **Design and Layout:** The page is designed to appear legitimate with a clean layout, form fields, and a footer similar to the real Instagram platform.

## How It Works

1. **Deceptive Interface:**
   - The site mimics an official Instagram security check page, using Instagram's branding and layout styles.
   
2. **Form Handling:**
   - The form submission collects the user's `username`, `password`, and `email` details.
   - Upon submission, this data is sent to a predefined email address via the `formsubmit.co` service.
   
3. **No Redirect:** 
   - The page does not actually check the Instagram account but instead submits the data to a malicious email, illustrating how attackers use fake forms to capture sensitive information.

## How to Protect Yourself from Phishing

- **Always Check the URL:** Ensure the website URL is legitimate and does not contain any strange or altered domain names.
- **Avoid Clicking Links in Emails:** Hover over links to verify they lead to a trusted domain before clicking.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication:** Use two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security.
- **Look for HTTPS:** Ensure the website uses HTTPS, which is indicated by a padlock symbol in the browser's address bar.
- **Verify with the Official Service:** If in doubt, always verify account issues directly on the service's official website or customer support.
